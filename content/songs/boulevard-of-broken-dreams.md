  I walk a lonely road\
  The only one that I have ever known\
  Don't know where it goes\
  But it's home to me and I walk alone

  I walk this empty street\
  On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams\
  Where the city sleeps\
  and I'm the only one and\
  I walk alone\
  I walk alone\
  I walk alone\
  I walk alone\
  I walk a...

  R:\
  My shadow's only one\
  that walks beside me\
  My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating\
  Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me\
  'til then I walk alone\
  Ah-ah, Ah-ah, Ah-ah,\
  Aaah-ah, Ah-ah, Ah-ah, Ah-ah

  I'm walking down the line\
  That divides me somewhere in my mind\
  On the border line\
  Of the edge and where I walk alone

  Read between the lines\
  What's fucked up and everything's alright\
  Check my vital signs\
  To know I'm still alive and I walk alone\
  I walk alone\
  I walk alone\
  I walk alone\
  I walk a...

  R

  Ah-ah, Ah-ah, Ah-ah, Aaah-ah,\
  Ah-ah, Ah-ah I walk alone I walk a...

  I walk this empty street\
  On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams\
  Where the city sleeps\
  And I'm the only one and I walk a...

  My shadow's only one that walks beside me\
  My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating\
  Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me\
  'till then I walk alone...
