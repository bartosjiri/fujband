  No more tears, my heart is dry\
  I don't laugh and I don’t cry\
  I don’t think about you all the time\
  But when I do, I wonder why

  You had to go out of my door\
  And leave just like you did before\
  I know I said that I was sure\
  But rich men can't imagine poor

  One day baby, we'll be old\
  Oh baby we'll be old\
  And think of all the stories\
  that we coulda told

  One day baby, we'll be old\
  Oh baby we'll be old\
  And think of all the stories\
  that we coulda told

  Little me and little you\
  Kept doing all the things they do\
  They never really think it through\
  Like I can never think you're true

  Here I go again – the blame,\
  the guilt, the pain, the hurt the shame.\
  The founding fathers of our plane\
  that's stuck in heavy clouds of rain.

  One day baby, we'll be old\
  oh baby we'll be old\
  and think of all the stories\
  that we coulda told
