  I am the passenger\
  And I ride and I ride\
  I ride through the city's backsides\
  I see the stars come out of the sky\
  Yeah, they're bright in a hollow sky\
  You know it looks so good tonight

  I am the passenger I stay under glass\
  I look through my window so bright\
  I see the stars come out tonight\
  I see the bright and hollow sky\
  Over the city's a rip in the sky\
  And everything looks good tonight

  Singin' la la la la lalalala...
