  In the summertime\
  when the weather is high\
  you can stretch right up\
  and touch the sky\
  when the weather is fine\
  you got women\
  you got women\
  on your mind\
  have a drink\
  have a drive\
  go out and see\
  what you can find

  If her daddy´s rich\
  take her out for a meal\
  if her daddy´s poor\
  just do what you feel\
  speed along the lane\
  do a ton or a ton an´ twenty five\
  when the sun goes down\
  you can make it\
  make it good or do lay-by

  We´re not bad people\
  we´re not dirty\
  we´re not mean\
  we love everybody\
  but we do as we please\
  when the weather´s fine\
  we go fishing or go\
  swimming in the sea\
  we´re always happy\
  life´s for living yeah\
  that´s our philosophy

  Sing along with us\
  dee dee dee dee dee\
  da du da da da\
  yeah we´re hap-happy\
  da da da dee da du\
  dee da du da du\
  ya da du da da da\
  da da da du da da\
  alright ah
